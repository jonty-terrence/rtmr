        <h3>The Living Wage</h3>
        <p>
          "A living wage is the income necessary to provide workers and their families with the basic 
          necessities of life. A living wage will enable workers to live with dignity and to 
          participate as active citizens in society. We call upon the Government, employers and society 
          as a whole to strive for a living wage for all households as a necessary and important step in the 
          reduction of poverty in New Zealand.‚Äù
